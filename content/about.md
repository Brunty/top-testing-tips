I've kept notes on things learned in testing, and want to share them as I think they're things that are good to know. Things that aren't often considered but can make life easier when writing tests for your code.

Testing is something that I'm passionate about and writing tests and test tooling makes me happy.

The examples on this site are often in PHP (as that's what I primarily work with), though they apply to almost any language and shouldn't be too difficult to read, regardless of what languages you're familiar with.
